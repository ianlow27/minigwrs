//´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´´===========================
Example Usage:
Step 1: Open the file "testun" using vi in a bash shell.
Step 2: Write your text in English i.e. the source language that your student speaks, not the target language that your student wishes to learn i.e. Welsh. Below is an example:
Good morning!
How are you?
What is your name?
Step 3: NOTE!! All lines are ignored except lines that start with backtick (`) or pipe (|). Add the line "|=====" (pipe followed by 5x or more equal signs) before and after the text  to indicate the section start and end.
Step 4: Start each line to be analyzed with the pipe symbol (|).
Step 5: Suffix each word that you want your student to the learn the Welsh translation of with a backtick (`). Your text should now look like this:
&emsp; |=================
&emsp; |Good` morning`!
&emsp; |How` are_you`?
&emsp; |What` is` your` name`?
&emsp; |=================
Step 6: In vi command mode go to the last line of the file (Shift+G) and run "r! a1". This will output a list of possible Welsh words for the English as shown below:
&emsp; !1) ydych~vbinf = are_you
&emsp; !2) cymwynasgar~adj/da~adj/daiawn~adj/daioni~nm/daionus~adj/lles~nm/mad~adj = good
&emsp; !3) cyn~adv/dychrymu~vbinf/mor~adv/mor~adv/pa_fodd~adv/pa_wedd~adv/sut~adv = how
&emsp; !4) mae~vbinf/sy~vbinf/sydd~vbinf/ydyw~vbinf/ys~vbinf/yw~vbinf = is
&emsp; !5) bore~nm/bore~nm/boregwaith~nm/boreol~adj/bore~nm/boreuol~adj/dydd~nm = morning
&emsp; !6) enw~nm/enw~nm/enwi~vbinf/henw~nm = name
&emsp; !7) beth~pron/beth~pron/beth~pron/by~conj/nan~adv/pa~adj/peth~adj/py~adj = what
&emsp; !8) 'ch~pron/eich~adj/eich~pron/eich~pron/eich~pron/'th~pron = your
&emsp; *** *** (8 geiriau)
Step 7: In VI Command mode press "u" to undone the previous command to remove the list of Welsh words. Then continue expanding the English text with backticks as you did in steps 1 to 5. Keep on repeating steps 6 to 7 until you have 28 words. If the word does not exist in the vocab i.e. geirfa23.txt, you will be prompted in Welsh to add it in. If there is any word that does not exist in the list of already used words i.e. geiriau.txt you will also be notified in Welsh. When you have 28 new Welsh words, then your English text should look something like this:
&emsp; |=================
&emsp; |Good` morning`!
&emsp; |How` are_you`?
&emsp; |What` is` your` name`?
&emsp; |How` are_you` today`?
&emsp; |Are_you` happy` or sad`?
&emsp; |My` name` is` Peter.
&emsp; |I` am` happy` today`.
&emsp; |Who` is` he`? He` is` my` father`.
&emsp; |What` is` his` name`? His` name` is` Jonathan.
&emsp; |Who` is` she`? She` is` my` mother`.
&emsp; |What` is` her` name`? Her` name` is` Margaret.
&emsp; |Who` is` he`? He` is` my` brother`.
&emsp; |What` is` his` name`? His` name` is` Mike.
&emsp; |Who` is` she`? She` is` my` sister`.
&emsp; |What` is` her` name`? Her` name` is` Marianne.
&emsp; |How` old` is` your` brother`?
&emsp; |See_you` later`!
&emsp; |Bye` then`!
&emsp; |=================
Step 8: Go to the end of the file (Shift+G) and then run "r! a1". This should append the following lines at the bottom of the file:
&emsp; !1) ydwyf~vbinf = am
&emsp; !2) ydych~vbinf = are_you
&emsp; !3) brawd~nm/brawd~nm/brawd~nm = brother

&emsp; *** _ JONATHAN_  _ MARGARET_  _ MARIANNE_  _ MIKE_  or_brim~nm/if~conj/limit~nm/margin~nm`  _ PETER_  *** (92 geiriau)
Step 9: Now select the correct Welsh word for the English word in the text by suffixing the correct Welsh term with the backtick (`). For example in the line "!6) cymwynasgar~adj/da~adj/daiawn~adj/daioni~nm/daionus~adj/lles~nm/mad~adj = good" if the correct Welsh word is "da~adj" then suffix this with "`" e.g. "da~adj`" so that the line becomes "!6) cymwynasgar~adj/da~adj`/daiawn~adj/daioni~nm/daionus~adj/lles~nm/mad~adj = good". Repeat this for all 28 words.
Step 10: Then go to the end of the file and run "r! a2". This will output the following lines as shown below:
&emsp; `ffeil=gwersxxx
&emsp; `gwers=Welsh Lesson xxxb - Beginner-2 Dechreuwr
&emsp; `teitl=Vocab Stanza xxx/Reading Vocab
&emsp; `1) 'th =  your~pron

&emsp; `5) dydd =  morning~nm
&emsp; `6) ei_un_ef =  his~adv
&emsp; `7) gwela_di =  see_you~phrs
&emsp; `8) hapus =  happy~adj

&emsp; `10) hen =  old~adj
&emsp; `11) henw =  name~nm
&emsp; `12) hi =  she~pron
&emsp; `13) hwyl =  bye~phrs
&emsp; `14) hwyrach =  later~adj

&emsp; `llun3=gwacter/1/3/7
&emsp; `llun4=gwacter/80/495/325
&emsp; `===========
Step 11: Amend the output filename accordingly from gwersxxx to something else. 
Step 12: Then manually replace the English words with the Welsh words that you selected earlier in step 9. Make sure to add an output filename, e.g. gwers001c. Your text should now look like the text below. Note that the letters t, and h were used in front of letters in square brackets to indicate mutations from the unmutated forms in the vocab. These letters are m (soft), t (nasal), a (breathed), h (h-prefix), d (none), and c (mixed). Note also that multi-word terms when not hyphenated are joined by underscores in the English and the Welsh:
&emsp; |=================
&emsp; |ffeil=gwers001c
&emsp; |Boreu` da`!
&emsp; |Sut` wyt_ti`?
&emsp; |Beth` yw` dy` enw`?
&emsp; |Sut` wyt_ti` heddiw`?
&emsp; |Are_you` happy` or sad`?
&emsp; |Fy` enw` yw` Peter.
&emsp; |Fi'n` hapus` heddiw`.
&emsp; |Pwy` yw` ef`? Ef` yw` fy` t[nh]ad`.
&emsp; |Beth` yw` ei` enw`? Ei` enw` yw` Jonathan.
&emsp; |Pwy` yw` hi`? Hi` yw` fy` mam`.
&emsp; |Beth` yw` ei` h[h]enw`? Ei` h[h]enw` yw` Margaret.
&emsp; |Pwy` yw` ef`? Ef` yw` fy` n[m]rawd`.
&emsp; |Beth` yw` ei` enw`? Ei` enw` yw` Mike.
&emsp; |Pwy` yw` hi`? Hi` yw` fy` chwaer`.
&emsp; |Beth` yw` ei` h[h]enw`? Ei` h[h]enw` yw` Marianne.
&emsp; |Wela_di` yn_hwyrach`!
&emsp; |Hwyl` te`!
&emsp; |=================
Step 13: Go to the end of the file and run "!cwrs". This will generate the HTML output files with the filename as specified with the "ffeil=" setting.
Step 14: You are now ready to add the next lesson. This is simply a matter of adding the new lesson to the already existing lines in the testun file. Repeat steps 1 to 13 above, making to give each section a unique output filename so that the generated HTML files do not overwrite each other. You will know which new English words to avoid as running "r! a1" will advise you. You will also know which Welsh words you missed. The same command will advise you in Welsh.

|ffeil=gwers001c
|gwers=1-3 Notes on the Welsh Alphabet
|teitl=1-3 Nodynnau ar yr Egwyddor Cymraeg
|1) C - never soft like "s-" - e.g. the girl's name {*Cerys*} is pronounced {*Kair-r'rihs*}  {/}
|2) Dd - thick "th" like this - e.g. the boy's name {*Dafydd*} is pronounced {*Dah-vihdh*}{/}
|3) G - never soft like "j-" - e.g. the boy's name {*Geraint*} is pronounced {*Gair-r'ra'int*} {/}
|4) I - is referred to as {*ee-dot*} to distinguish it from the U which is also referred to as {*ee-pedol*} (meaning "ee-stirrup). When at the front of a word and followed by a vowel it is pronounced as a consonant Y with a "yuh" sound, e.g.  the boys' names {*Iolo*}, and {*Iestin*} are pronounced {*Yor-lor*}, and {*Yes-tin*}. {/}
|5) Ll - "huh" followed by "luh" - e.g. the boy's name {*Llew*} is pronounced {*Hlair-oo*}{/}
|6) Ph - same sound as ff - e.g. th girl's name {*Phylys*} is pronounced {*Fuh-lihs*} {/}
|7) R - always rolled when not followed by h - e.g. as in the boy's name {*Geraint*} {/}
|8) Rh - "huh" followed by "ruh" - e.g. the boy's name {*Rhys*} is pronounced {*Hrihs*}{/}
|9) Th - thin "th" like thistle - e.g. the girls's name {*Delyth*} is pronounced {*Dair-lith*} {/}
|10) U - "ee" followed by "ur". Centuries ago this was "ee" followed by "oo" but evolved over time to "eeuh". This is also sometimes referred to as {*ee-pedol*} (meaning "ee" stirrup because it looks like a stirrup) - e.g. the boy's name {*Tudur*} is pronounced {*Tir-deer'r*} {/}
|11) Y - "uh" as in "bird" except in the final syllable where it widens to an "ih" as in "bid" - e.g. as in the girl's name {*Phylys*} {/}
|12) When using English acronyms in modern Welsh one simply uses the English letter names, e.g. "UN" is "Yioo-En" and "HMRC" is "Aitch-em-ar-see". {/}
|13) When using Welsh acronyms one uses the traditional Welsh alphabet which you haven't been taught yet. For example {*S4C*} is {*Es-Pedwar-Eck*}, and {*ABC*} when referring to the Welsh alphabet is {*Ah-Bi-Eck*}{/}
|14) When consonants are doubled, e.g. "bb", "mm", "rr", "nn", and "pp" this leads to a shortening and slight aspiration of the consonant sound e.g. {*cymmwys*} (archaic spelling) meaning "exact" is pronounced  {*kuhmm-hwys*}, {*cynnwys*} meaning "contents" is pronounced {*kuhnn-hwys*}, and {*carrai*} meaning "strap" is pronounced {*kah-hrai*}{/}
|15) Dipthongs sound exactly like the two component vowels placed side by side and pronounced quickly, e.g. {*caer*} meaning "fort" is pronounced {*kah-air-r'r*}, {*troi*} meaning "to turn" is pronounced {*tr'r-or-ee*}, and {*ddoe*} meaning "yesterday" is pronounced {*dhor-air*}.{/}

|gwers=2-3 Notes on Basic Greetings
|teitl=2-3 Nodynnau ar Gyfarchiadau Sylfaenol
|1) Adjectives come after the noun. In English it's "Good morning", in Welsh it is "Morning good". Therefore {*Bore da*} means {*morning good*}, {*Prynhawn da*} means {*afternoon good*}, and {*Noswaith dda*} means {*evening good*}. {/}
|2) Note that the word "da" starting with a "d" changes to "dda" after the feminine singular noun "noswaith" meaning evening. This is an example of Welsh mutations. Here we have a {*soft mutation*} that changes the {*D*} "duh" sound to the softer {*DD*} "dhuh" sound.  {/}
|3) Similar to French, Welsh has a different pronoun for you singular, this is "ti", which is similar to the old-fashioned word "thou" in English. In English we use "you" for you singular when we are speaking to a single person. In Welsh, we normally use the word "ti" for a single person, unless it is in a formal situation such as speaking to strangers, customers, or official people. {/}
|4) The subject pronouns I, thou, he, she, we, you, and they in Welsh are fi, ti, ef, hi, ni, chi, and nhw. In English the object pronouns differ from the subject pronouns, i.e. they are me, thee, him, her, us, you, and them. In Welsh subject and object pronouns are generally the same. For example, "I" in Welsh is "fi", and "me" in Welsh is "fi" as well. There is one exception which is "di" meaning you singular. This has a soft mutation "d" from the letter "t" in "ti". {/}
|5) The possessive pronouns my, thy, his, her, our, your, and their, in Welsh is fy, dy, ei, ei, ein, eich, and eu. Therefore "fy enw" means "my name", and "dy enw" means "your name". However, in Welsh when using possessive pronouns we always add the object pronoun after the noun. This is because the possessive pronouns are very short single-syllabic words. Therefore these need to be bolstered with the object pronoun after the noun, e.g. "fy enw i" meaning "my name me", and "dy enw di" meaning your name you.  {/}
|6) To say "I am", "you are", "he is", "she is", "we are", "you are", and "they are" followed by an adjective in Welsh, we can simply add the word "yn" meaning "in" to the pronoun followed by the adjective. For example, "Fi yn hapus", literally meaning, "I in happy" is a very common colloquial way of expressing oneself in Welsh. The "yn" is very often abbreviated to just apostrophe n "'m" after a vowel, e.g. "fi'n hapus", "ti'n iawn", "ni'n weddol". {/}
|7) There are three words in Welsh that means "is", "yw", "ydy", and "mae". To say "I am", "you are", "he is", "she is", "we are", "you are", and "they are" followed by a noun or name in Welsh, we can use "yw" and "ydy". For example, "fi yw myfyriwr", literally meaning "I is student", translates to "I am a student". "Ni yw athrawon", literally meaning "we is teachers", translates to "we are teachers". {/}
|8) "Mawr" means "great". To form an adverb from an adjective we simply add "yn" meaning "in" and affect the soft mutation, so that te "m" in "mawr" softens to "f" in "fawr". "Greatly" therefore is "yn fawr". {/}
|9) The word for "to" "i" affects the soft mutation so the "c" in "cael cwrdd" meaning "to meet" softens to the "g" in "gael cwrdd". {/}
|10) Similarly  "ti" means you singular. However, after the word for "with" "a^" which affects the breathed mutation, the "t" in "ti" is breathalized to a "th" in "thi". {/}

|gwers=3-3 Notes on Meet the Family
|teitl=3-3 Nodynnau ar Gael Cwrdd a^r Teulu
|1) "Sut mae" is a common way of saying "hi". If you want to speak in Welsh with someone just say "Sut mae". This is pronounced "Shwmae" in the South, and "S'mae" in the North.
|2) In the previous lesson we learnt "fi'n hapus", "ti'n hapus", "e'n hapus", "hi'n hapus", "ni'n hapus", "chi'n hapus", and "nhw'n hapus" meaning literally "I in happy", "you in happy", "he in happy", etc. to say "I am happy", "you are happy", and "he is happy". This is a common but strictly speaking ungrammatical and informal way of expressing oneself. To say this more formally, one can add the word to be. Therefore "mae ef yn" word for word means "is he in". So to say "he is happy" we say "is he in happy", "mae ef yn hapus". This gets shorted to "mae e'n hapus". Similarly we also have "rydw i'n hapus", "rydwyt ti'n hapus", "mae hi'n hapus", "rydym ni'n hapus", "rydych chi'n hapus", and "maent nhw'n hapus".
|3) The possessive pronound "fy" meaning "my" affects the nasal mutation. Therefore the initial letter "t" at the start of a word mutates to "nh" after fy, e.g. "tad" becomes "fy nhad".
|4) "mam" means "mother" and "cu" means "dear". However, "dear" being an adjective following a singular feminine noun affects the soft mutation and its "c" at the start softens to a "g". Therefore we have "mam-gu" and not "mam-cu" for grandmother which literally means "dear mother".
|5) If we don't know the Welsh word for something then we normally just use the English word, because everyone speaks English. Therefore here in the words "ffeindio" and "ffrind", these are obviously borrowings from the English but they are so commonly used they have become part of standard Modern Welsh.
|6) We previously encountered the word "yw" to mean "is". We also encountered another word "mae" which has the same meaning. Here we have a third word "ydy" meaning the same thing. When we want to ask a question, we use "ydy". When we want to make a statement we use "mae". When we want to say something equals something we use "yw". Therefore we use "ydy" in "Pam ydy hi yn drist?", meaning "why is she sad?"
|7) "Ddim" originally means "any" or "at all". Therefore "ni all hi ddim ffeindio" literally means "not can she at all find". However, as mentioned before the stress in Welsh is at the end of a word or phrase. We can say "ni all ffeindio" meaning "not can he or she find", but because "ni all" at the front of the phrase are very short syllables, it is much clearer when we add "hi" and "ddim" after "ni all". Therefore "ddim" over the years has come to mean "not" because the word "ni" is often dropped at the front.
|8) Note the soft mutation of "trist" to "drist" after the word "yn" meaning "in".
|9) Note the breathed mutation of "ci" to "chi" after the word "ei" meaning "her".
|10) Note that plurals are formed in Welsh by adding "au" and "iau" to the ends of words, hence "ffrind" (friend) becomes "ffriandiau" (friends). The "i-" is usually added in front of the "au" depending on the end consonant. If it is a vowel or soft consonant like "ff", "h", "m", "n", "r", "s", or "w" then the "i-" is usually omitted e.g. "rhaff" (rope) becomes "rhaffau" (ropes), otherwise it is added to soften the consonant.
